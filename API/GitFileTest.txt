This is added to check the git commit step:

git clone https://github.com/namithak1/FST_M1 -> To get copy of the git folder to your local system
git add . -> To add all new files
git commit -m "Adding new file" -> Commiting the files, but won't add it to the respository yet 
git push origin main -> This will push the commit to the repository and you can see the files in git repository (cloud)


After creating new repository in git hub with same name as the local folder name:
cd TheNewFolderWhichYouWantToCommit. Eg: cd IBM_FST_Copy
git init -b main -> This will make the local folder as git folder(which is commitable)
git add .  -> Adds all files from the folder (even though there are no files even then need to use this command)
git commit -m "Adding all files" 
git remote add origin https://github.com/namithak1/NewFolderRepositoryName 
git push origin main

Branches: After creating branches in github eg: Develpoment
git pull -> Used incase if you get error while switching the branch
git checkout Development -> just switches to Development branch

git checkout -b Develop -> creates new branch and switches to the new branch
git add .
git commit -m "adding new branch"
git push origin Develop

Merge Conflict:
A same File abc.txt in Dev and QA branch is modified and committed, now while merging there is a merge conflict

git checkout Dev -> Switch to Dev branch
git merge QA -> Add the content of QA branch to Dev branch
-> if conflict comes then manually go to the abc.txt file, update the changes accordingly and commit it using
git add .
git commit -m "resolving merge conflict"
git push origin Dev
